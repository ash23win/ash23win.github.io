    title: "Toward Sustainable Purification and Separation Processes"
    excerpt: "The PAST laboratory aims to develop sustainable technologies for challenging purification and separation problems. To achieve this the research activities span all the way from understanding fundamentals to developing processes. *Particulate Technology*, *Gas Separation*, and *Porous Materials* are the three focus areas of the laboratory. <br />"

<h3 id="ParTech">Particulate Technology</h3>
Crystals can be found today in every aspect of our lives. They appear either as a naturally occurring material or as a chemically synthesized product from a industrial process. Minerals, gemstones, and snowflakes are examples of the former, while pharmaceutical drugs, sugar, table salt, and cocoa fat in chocolates are examples of the latter. Crystallization is a separation and purification technique, which is defined as a phase change in which a crystalline product is obtained from a solution or a melt. Crystallization processes are frequently applied in food, in bioprocessing, and in pharmaceuticals industries, to name a few. The crystalline products from these industries are produced in scales ranging from a few milligrams to a few thousand tons annually. Even though the process of crystallization appears simple on paper, there exist several bottlenecks for a robust, reliable, and safe operation. Irrespective of the widespread use of crystallization for decades, it can be said with certainty that it is poorly understood.

The work performed in this group will hold a small piece of a very large puzzle aimed to understand and to develop better processes involing particulate matter (or crystals here). The work here falls within the broader domain of *Crystal Shape Engineering*. As of today the research topics that are being pursued are:
* Characterization of the size and shape of particulate populations
* Manipulation of the size and shape of particulate populations
* Downstream processability of crystallized products

<h4 id="ParTech">Manipulation of the size and shape of particulate populations</h4>
Recent developments in imaging techniques have led to characterizing nonequant crystals (particularly needle-like crystals) with moderate to high accuracy, which was not possible till a few years back. This has contributed to an increased interest in size and shape manipulation of nonequant crystals, which influences the downstream processing operations. Processes developed to manipulate the size and shape of nonequant populations have exploited temperature cycling or mechanical action or combination of these (see Figure 1). It was evident from many of these studies that incorporating additional actuators like antisolvent or growth inhibiting modifiers might be beneficial to induce a broader manipulation of size and shape.

In this sub area, the goal is to develop size and shape manipulation processes for nonequant compounds (e.g. elongated morphology, plate-like morphology) using a variety of actuators. To this aim, the following steps are usually considered:
* Development of a multidimensional mathematical model to describe the process
* Estimating the multidimensional growth/dissolution kinetics of a model compound
* Fine-tuning the process using the estimated kinetics, optimizing the process in a modeling framework, and testing the performance in an experimental setting
* Employing feedback control methodologies to have a robust process performance
