# A bit about me
## What am I like?
I would call myself an engineer first and researcher second. I am passionate about engineering devices bottom-up and if need be also top-down ;-) That includes designing the device, the electronics, the software, and most importantly the look and feel. As a kid, I wasn't much fascinated by mathematics. These days it forms the core of my research (thanks to my former mentors).{: .text-justify} <br />

Apart from research, a typical day in my life revolves around reading random Wikipedia articles and watching random YouTube videos (usually not so random, I do have preferences) and scrolling though my Twitter feed. When time permits I do enjoy a nice movie or TV Show. {: .text-justify}

## What drives me to do research?
A very strong personal conviction to act and to build a better tomorrow and leave a *healthy* planet for future generations.
