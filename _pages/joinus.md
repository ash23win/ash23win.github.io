# A bit about me (Ashwin)
## What am I like?
I would call myself an engineer first and then a researcher. I am passionate about (reverse)-engineering devices. That includes designing the device, the electronics, the software, and most importantly the look and feel. As a kid, I wasn't much fascinated by mathematics. These days it forms the core of my research (thanks to my former mentors). So you can expect the kind of research I like to do to be a good mix of experimental and computational in nature.

## What drives me to do research?
A very strong personal conviction to act and to build a better tomorrow and leave a *healthy* planet for future generations.

## My mentoring style?
We are in this together as a team. We learn, we struggle, and we celebrate the success together. I acknowledge that I will not have answers to all your questions. But isn't the fun part of doing research to get the answers for those questions?

## My choice of research tools?
I am a strong advocate of openness in science. This includes freely sharing the data and simulation tools developed to the broader scientific community. This would translate to my personal preference for the the students to use open-source platforms like Python, Julia, R, Arduino, Linux, Inkscape, Latex, and many more! (Not a problem at all if you are not aware of this. All one needs is the curiosity to learn!)
